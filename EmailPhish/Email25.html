                <p>Derik Sheleeb, FB1, isn't really from the FBI. The FBI wouldn't want to trick you by putting 1 instead of an i, nor would they use the Outlook mail service at the end of it. The most likely domain they would use is something along the lines of fbi.gov. Good job noticing this!</p>

                <p>This subject is trying to threaten the reader of the email by saying that there were suspicious activities in their internet. It doesn't say exactly what was suspicious, so it temps a reader to click to see what is about. Therefore, this is an example of a suspicious item in a phishing attempt. </p>

                <p>A vague greeting such as "Dear Chase OnlineSM Customer" may be a big indicator of phishing, especially if it came from a big company such as a bank. Most of these big companies would address the reader by their first and last name. Good work noticing this!</p>

                <p>This body is threating the user with prosecution if they don't allow the "FBI" to investigate their suspicious internet activity. This tackles two things: a person's fear of authority and their fear of guilt if they have performed something they feared was suspicious. Not only that, it is also asking for the user's router information, something that wouldn't be done through email even if it is the police who is asking for it. Good work! </p>
